# CV

This is my Curriculum Vitae, it is made in LaTeX using a custom template I created.
I was mostly inspired by [Rezume](https://github.com/nanup/Rezume), [TwentySecondCV](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/TwentySecondsCurriculumVitae-LaTex) and [ModernCV](https://github.com/moderncv/moderncv).
You can reuse the template if you want to.

The configuration options do not seem to work yet, maybe I will correct it one day.
